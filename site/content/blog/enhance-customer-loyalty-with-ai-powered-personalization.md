## Explanation of AI powered personalization



Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered personalization involves employing this technology to customize experiences for every customer. Think of AI as a smart assistant who considers a variety of data on your usage patterns. It keeps track of your purchases, viewing habits, and preferences. It then makes use of this knowledge to determine potential future goals.



Businesses may provide you with items that match your interests thanks to this unique AI technology. For instance, AI may provide recommendations for things you will probably enjoy while you're shopping online based on previous purchases. It may also alter the material you view on websites, applications, and emails so that it appears to have been written specifically for you.



Personalization enabled by AI isn't limited to one area. It functions on websites, applications, and even in business communications. It's similar to having a personal assistant who understands your interests and guides you toward stuff you'll appreciate.
