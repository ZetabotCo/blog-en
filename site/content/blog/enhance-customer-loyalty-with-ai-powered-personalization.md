For instance, when shopping online, AI can suggest items you're likely to enjoy based on your past purchases. It can also customize the content you encounter on websites, apps, and emails, making it seem as if it was crafted just for you.

The realm of AI-driven personalization knows no bounds. It operates seamlessly on websites, apps, and even in business communications.
