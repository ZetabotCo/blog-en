Zetabot will smoothly hands over your question to your team (Customer Support team). As it does, Zetabot pays close attention, records, and remembers the entire conversation between you and the customer. 



Picture the Zetabot like a digital sponge, soaking up valuable knowledge. 

Once your team resolves the issue, Zetabot closes the case, remembering and storing the solution for next time.



This means every chat with Zetabot gets easier because it keeps learning and improving at solving problems.



So, whether Zetabot nails it right away or teams up with your team, one thing is for sure: Zetabot keeps getting smarter with each chat and is always learning to help you!
