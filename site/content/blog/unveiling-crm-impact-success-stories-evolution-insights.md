## What is customer relationship management (CRM)?

As opposed to being merely a technical instrument, CRM is fundamentally a philosophy that places customers above all other factors when making business decisions. A strong CRM system is more important than ever as industries change and customer demands rise.

This segmentation facilitates tailored strategies and communications, enhancing the relevance of marketing and sales initiatives, and ultimately strengthening relationships with different customer segments.
