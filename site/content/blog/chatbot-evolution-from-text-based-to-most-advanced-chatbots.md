## The Early Days of Chatbots

Commencing with the pioneering work of Joseph Weizenbaum, a scientist hailing from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the year 1966 witnessed the birth of ELIZA. ELIZA, a groundbreaking program, embarked on the ambitious endeavor of making a computer converse akin to a human being.

ELIZA operated by employing straightforward rules to decipher human dialogue. It relied on pre-constructed patterns to generate responses, thereby creating the illusion of genuine conversation.

Following the footsteps of ELIZA, there emerged PARRY in 1972, crafted by Kenneth Colby, a distinguished professor of psychiatry at Stanford University. PARRY assumed the persona of an individual with schizophrenia while incorporating ELIZA's conversational style. Nevertheless, it distinguished itself with a more sophisticated approach to dialogue.

**More chatbots appeared after ELIZA and PARRY:**

1. **Dr. Sbaitso:** Forged by Creative Technology in the early 1990s, this chatbot possessed the ability to articulate speech, transcending the confines of mere text-based communication.
2. **Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity (A.L.I.C.E.):** Engineered by Richard Wallace in 1995, A.L.I.C.E. relied on simplistic rules akin to ELIZA for generating responses.
3. **Jabberwacky:** The brainchild of Rollo Carpenter, Jabberwacky entered the scene in 1997, seeking to engage in lighthearted. human-like conversations
4. **SmarterChild:** Conceived by ActiveBuddy in 2001, SmarterChild rose to prominence on AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and MSN Messenger, captivating users with its interactive capabilities.

## Chatbots Evolution from 2001 to Present Day

After gaining popularity among AIM and MSN Messenger users, SmarterChild garnered widespread recognition. In the year 2010, IBM introduced Watson, a specialized AI chatbot designed to compete on the iconic game show Jeopardy!. Watson's versatility extends to various domains, including:

**Customer Service:** Watson plays a pivotal role in addressing customer inquiries, providing comprehensive support, and proficiently resolving issues.
