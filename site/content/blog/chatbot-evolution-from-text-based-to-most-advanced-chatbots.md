The Early Days of Chatbots
Starting with Joseph Weizenbaum, a scientist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), ELIZA was developed in 1966. ELIZA is a program that tries to make a computer talk like a human.

ELIZA worked by using simple rules to understand what people said. It used pre-written patterns to reply, making it seem like a conversation.

After ELIZA came PARRY, created in 1972 by Kenneth Colby, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University. PARRY pretended to be like a person with schizophrenia and talked like ELIZA. But it was different because it had a smarter way of talking.

More chatbots appeared after ELIZA and PARRY:

Dr. Sbaitso: Created by Creative Technology in the early 1990s. It could talk out loud, not just in text.

Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity (A.L.I.C.E.): Made by Richard Wallace in 1995. It used simple rules like ELIZA.

Jabberwacky: Created in 1997 by Rollo Carpenter. It tried to chat like a human in a fun way.

SmarterChild: Made by ActiveBuddy in 2001. It became famous on AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and MSN Messenger.

Chatbots Evolution from 2001 to Present Day

After becoming popular with users of AIM and MSN Messenger, SmarterChild gained recognition. In 2010, IBM introduced Watson, an AI chatbot specifically designed to compete on the game show Jeopardy!. Watson can be used for various purposes, such as:

Customer Service: Watson can help answer customer questions, provide support, and solve problems.

Healthcare: Watson can help diagnose illnesses, suggest treatments, and support patients.

Finance: Watson can analyze financial data, make predictions, and give investment advice.

Education: Watson can create personalized learning materials, give feedback, and answer student questions.

Research: Watson can analyze research data, find patterns, and make predictions.

Not long after Watson was released, Apple introduced Siri in 2011, Siri is a virtual assistant designed to help users of Apple products interact through voice commands. Siri can be used to do various tasks, such as:

Making Calls: Siri can call people from your phone contacts or new numbers.

Sending Messages: Siri can send messages to contacts from your phone or new numbers.

Setting Alarms: Siri can set alarms for specific times or events.

Finding Information: Siri can search the internet for information, like weather, news, and locations.

Controlling Devices: Siri can control other Apple devices, like HomePod and Apple TV.

Answering Questions: Siri can answer your questions about different topics, like weather, news, and sports.


AI-powered Chatbot: Most Advanced Chatbot until Now

The emergence of Jasper AI and ChatGPT has sparked a wave of interest in generative AI chatbots, ranging from the general public to professionals and technology vendors. Generative AI chatbots are increasingly popular due to their ability in assisting in problem-solving, generating content ideas, and providing informative answers.

Nowadays, many businesses have started integrating AI into their chatbots, such as:

Amazon
	To address customer queries efficiently, Amazon employs AI to assist in answering customer needs, such as order tracking, returns, and payment issues.

Bank of America:
An AI-powered virtual assistant called Erica can help customers with banking queries, transactions, and offers personalized financial advice using conversational AI.

Woebot:
Woebot is an AI chatbot that provides mental health support. It can give their user empathetic conversations, using conversational AI to understand emotions, offer coping strategies, and provide cognitive-behavioral therapy.

If you're aware, the chatbots used by ChatGPT and the examples mentioned above are different. ChatGPT is a generative AI chatbot, while Amazon, Bank of America, and Woebot are examples of conversational AI chatbot. The difference lies in that:

Generative AI chatbots
	Generative AI refers to a technology that can create new content, such as text, images, or even videos, based on patterns it has learned from existing data.

Conversational AI chatbots
	Conversational AI, focuses on creating AI systems that can engage in natural-sounding conversations with humans.

Once you grasp  the difference between generative AI and conversational AI, you can choose which type is suitable for your business. Many businesses opt for conversational AI as they require human-like responses. We've discussed the history of chatbots and differentiated AI chatbot types. Now, how exactly can AI become a game-changer for chatbots?
How AI Revolutionize Chatbots

After understanding the impact of ChatGPT and Jasper AI, it's easy to see how people are becoming more interested in AI. Just imagine if your chatbot could use AI to streamline your customer complaint handling process. Now, let’s discover what AI is.

Artificial Intelligence is a computer program that can learn on its own. Simply by providing relevant data, AI can understand the context of that data and be ready to process it according to the user's preferences. AI has several components, and in chatbots, there are two important components that can effectively drive AI.

Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning focuses on enabling systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In a business analogy, ML acts like an archives division, starting from searching for data, collecting and analyzing it to generate insights and recommendations.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	Natural Language Processing focuses on interpreting the language used by customers, sends it to machine learning, and delivers responses back to customers. In a business analogy, NLP acts like a customer service division, gathering customer complaints and providing accurate and clear solutions.

By integrating AI into your business's chatbot, you will gain benefits such as:

Always Available
	AI chatbots are like helpful friends who never sleep. They're ready to assist you anytime, day or night, making sure you get the help you need whenever you need it.

Saves Money
	Using AI chatbots can save a lot of money. They can handle lots of tasks without needing as many people to help, which means businesses can use their money for other important things.

Quick Answers
	AI chatbots are super fast at answering questions. This is great because you don't have to wait a long time to get the information you want.

Grows with You
	As a business gets bigger, AI chatbots can handle more work without getting tired. This is really helpful when lots of people are asking questions or needing help all at once.

Treats You Special
	AI chatbots can remember what you like and help you better. It's like having a friend who knows exactly what you want and can help you find things you'll love.

It's really beneficial, isn't it? You'll definitely be interested in AI-powered chatbots. So, what do you think the future of chatbots with AI will look like? Let's find out what's coming next.

Enhanced Personalization 
In the future, AI-powered chatbots will be like personal assistants that truly understand your preferences. They will remember your previous interactions, your favorite products or services, and even your communication style. This means they can offer recommendations and solutions that align with your unique needs, making your experience feel more customized and valuable.

Natural Conversations
Imagine having a chat with a friend who understands you perfectly. Future chatbots will be able to engage in conversations that flow smoothly, mimicking human communication patterns. They will comprehend context, nuances, and even humor, leading to interactions that feel natural and effortless.

Emotional Intelligence
Chatbots might surprise you by recognizing your emotions through text or voice cues. This emotional understanding could lead to empathetic responses, such as providing encouragement when you're feeling down or celebrating achievements. This emotional connection could make interactions with chatbots feel more human and relatable.

Multi-Modal Interactions
Chatbots will evolve beyond just text-based interactions. They will incorporate various forms of media such as images, videos, and even voice commands. This will enable you to interact with them in ways that are more intuitive and engaging and enhance the overall user experience.

Seamless Integration
Imagine starting a conversation with a chatbot on a website, continuing it on a messaging app, and then seamlessly picking it up on a smart device at home. Future chatbots will work seamlessly across different platforms and devices, ensuring a consistent and unified experience wherever you interact with them. This convenience will make communication with businesses and services more effortless than ever before.
