## The Early Days of Chatbots

Commencing with the pioneering work of Joseph Weizenbaum, a scientist hailing from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the year 1966 witnessed the birth of ELIZA. ELIZA, a groundbreaking program, embarked on the ambitious endeavor of making a computer converse akin to a human being.

ELIZA operated by employing straightforward rules to decipher human dialogue. It relied on pre-constructed patterns to generate responses, thereby creating the illusion of genuine conversation.

Following the footsteps of ELIZA, there emerged PARRY in 1972, crafted by Kenneth Colby, a distinguished professor of psychiatry at Stanford University. PARRY assumed the persona of an individual with schizophrenia while incorporating ELIZA's conversational style. Nevertheless, it distinguished itself with a more sophisticated approach to dialogue.

**More chatbots appeared after ELIZA and PARRY:**

1. **Dr. Sbaitso:** Forged by Creative Technology in the early 1990s, this chatbot possessed the ability to articulate speech, transcending the confines of mere text-based communication.
2. **Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity (A.L.I.C.E.):** Engineered by Richard Wallace in 1995, A.L.I.C.E. relied on simplistic rules akin to ELIZA for generating responses.
3. **Jabberwacky:** The brainchild of Rollo Carpenter, Jabberwacky entered the scene in 1997, seeking to engage in lighthearted. human-like conversations
4. **SmarterChild:** Conceived by ActiveBuddy in 2001, SmarterChild rose to prominence on AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and MSN Messenger, captivating users with its interactive capabilities.

## Chatbots Evolution from 2001 to Present Day

After gaining popularity among AIM and MSN Messenger users, SmarterChild garnered widespread recognition. In the year 2010, IBM introduced Watson, a specialized AI chatbot designed to compete on the iconic game show Jeopardy!. Watson's versatility extends to various domains, including:

**Customer Service:** Watson plays a pivotal role in addressing customer inquiries, providing comprehensive support, and proficiently resolving issues.

**Healthcare:** In the healthcare realm, Watson lends its expertise to diagnose illnesses, propose treatment options, and offer valuable support to patients.

**Finance:** Watson's analytical prowess comes into play when it comes to dissecting financial data, making astute predictions, and dispensing investment advice.

**Education:** Watson's capabilities extend to crafting tailored educational materials, delivering constructive feedback, and addressing students' inquiries.

**Research:** In the research landscape, Watson proves its mettle by analyzing vast datasets, identifying intricate patterns, and making informed predictions.

Shortly after the advent of Watson, Apple unveiled Siri in 2011, marking a significant leap in the realm of virtual assistants. Siri, designed to facilitate interactions via voice commands, caters to users of Apple products and encompasses a diverse array of functionalities:

* **Making Calls:** Siri efficiently dials contacts from your phone directory or unknown numbers at your request.
* **Sending Messages:** Siri adeptly sends messages to contacts in your phonebook or to new recipients.
* **Setting Alarms:** Siri simplifies the process of configuring alarms for specific timings or important events.
* **Finding Information:** Siri's web-searching capabilities extend to retrieving information from the internet, encompassing areas like weather forecasts, news updates, and location details.
* **Controlling Devices:** Siri's reach extends to managing other Apple devices, including HomePod and Apple TV.
* **Answering Questions:** Siri serves as a knowledgeable companion, ready to provide answers to your inquiries across diverse topics, encompassing weather forecasts, news updates, and sports information.
