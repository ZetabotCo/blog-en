  automation to personalized interactions.
intro: >+
  According to a 2022 study by Temkin Group, 86% of customers are willing to pay
  more for a good customer experience-related product or service. We can infer
  from this fact that customer service is crucial. Customers frequently ask
  customer service representatives about the goods and services we provide.


  To make this happen, you need to monitor your agents and make sure they work well. You cannot keep an eye on your agents all the time, regrettably. There are many things you have to do. Imagine that there is digital technology that can help you monitor your agents without having to leave your other tasks. This technology can increase your agent’s performance, from assisting in receiving complaints and processing complaints to resolving complaints. This technology is called Artificial Intelligence (AI)


  With AI, you only need to receive reports, starting with how many complaints are resolved, how effectively your agents are working, and how many customers are satisfied with your business. What makes it even more remarkable is that AI can learn from your customer data to understand their wants and predict upcoming market trends. Stay tuned to discover AI advancements in customer service excellence.
