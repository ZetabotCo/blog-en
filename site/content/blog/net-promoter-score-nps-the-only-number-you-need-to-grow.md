Customer loyalty stands out as a cornerstone that not only ensures sustained profitability but also signifies a strong and enduring brand-consumer relationship. The importance of customer loyalty cannot be overstated, as loyal patrons not only contribute significantly to a company's revenue stream but also serve as brand advocates, influencing others positively.

The Net Promoter Score (NPS) emerges as a crucial metric for quantifying and measuring this elusive yet vital aspect of business success. By gauging the likelihood of customers recommending a product or service, NPS serves as a compass for customer loyalty.

## What is a Net Promoter Score?

Regarded as the benchmark in customer experience metrics, the NPS System was originally conceived by Bain and Company in 2003. Since then, countless businesses have used it as a common tool to assess and track their standing in the eyes of their customers.

NPS is a customer experience metric utilized in various customer loyalty programs. It assesses the level of customer loyalty to a company and is determined through a single-question survey. The resulting NPS rating is reported on a scale ranging from -100 to +100, with a higher score being preferable.

These scores play a pivotal role in distinguishing between negative and positive feedback, making the net promoter system an influential determinant of customer perception. The essence of NPS lies in a straightforward question: "How likely is it that you would recommend \[a brand] to a friend or colleague?"

## How is NPS Calculated?

After responding to the standard NPS question, "On a scale of 0–10, how likely is it that you would recommend \[a brand] to a friend or colleague?" They are categorized into three distinct groups based on their chosen scores:

1. Promoters

Promoters in NPS are customers who responded with a score of 9 or 10. These individuals serve as your most enthusiastic supporters, fostering loyalty and acting as advocates for your brand, ultimately contributing to overall growth.

2. Passives

Passives in NPS are customers who provide a score of 7 or 8. Essentially, they express moderate satisfaction with your product or service but lack strong loyalty, making them susceptible to competition.

3. Detractors

Detractors in NPS are customers who chose a score between 0 and 6. Not only are they unlikely to recommend your brand, but they also pose a risk of leaving and may actively discourage others from choosing your product. Minimizing the number of detractors is a crucial goal for ensuring customer satisfaction and retention.

### NPS Calculator

NPS Formula: % Promoters - % Detractors

For example, following a survey of 500 individuals, the outcomes are as follows:

* 300 individuals fall into the promoter category.
* 125 individuals are categorized as passive.
* 75 individuals are categorized as detractors.

This translates to:

* Promoter: (300/500)*100% = 60%
* Passive: (125/500)*100% = 25%
* Detractor: (75/500)*100% = 15%

The NPS score is calculated as 60–15, resulting in 45.

Since NPS is represented as a whole number rather than a percentage, your business's NPS score stands at 45. In certain scenarios, the NPS value might even dip into negative territory.

### NPS Scale

The Net Promoter Score has a scale that spans from -100 to 100. Businesses may apply their subjective perspectives to these scores, making them open to interpretation. However, a useful guideline is as follows:

* 70 or higher: Excellent
* 50 to 69: Good
* 49 or below: Needs Improvement
* Below: A Warning!

## The Benefits of Using the NPS System

1. Enhance Customer Satisfaction

One of the primary benefits of the Net Promoter Score is its immediate insight into customer satisfaction with the service you provide. For companies striving for overall customer happiness, NPS offers an effective measurement tool. Swift identification of any service lapses allows for timely intervention to address issues before they escalate into lingering concerns.

2. Increase Customer Loyalty

Satisfaction holds true value only when it translates into customer loyalty. The NPS system becomes instrumental in identifying genuine customer loyalty, and tracking changes over time helps evaluate the effectiveness of loyalty-building strategies. If necessary adjustments are identified, they can be implemented to foster lasting customer loyalty.

3. Foster Customer Advocacy

A natural extension of customer loyalty is the creation of advocates—individuals actively recommending your brand to friends, family, and colleagues. By identifying customers likely to recommend your business, NPS empowers you to harness the advocacy of satisfied customers, amplifying your brand's reach organically.

4. Reduce the churn rate.

While building promoters is crucial, preventing customer churn is paramount. Understanding your NPS enables a targeted approach to create an exceptional customer experience, enticing passives and detractors to transition into promoters.

5. Drive Sustainable Growth

Ultimately, the goal is sustainable business growth. NPS's actionable feedback serves as a catalyst for achieving this objective. Promoters emerge as the driving force behind growth—they spend more, exhibit lower price sensitivity, embrace new product offerings, influence others to make purchases, churn less frequently, and, in the long run, contribute to a higher lifetime value for your business.

## Elevating Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty Through the NPS System

According to Forbes, 83% of companies emphasizing customer happiness experience revenue growth. To boost loyalty, use the following strategies:

1. Send NPS Survey Regularly

It is crucial to consistently send NPS surveys across the entire customer journey. This practice enables the collection of feedback and the assessment of customer loyalty at various stages.

2. Uncover the Underlying Issue with a Follow-Up Question

NPS scores alone may not provide substantial insights unless you delve into the reasons behind them. Hence, incorporating a follow-up question in each survey is essential to understanding why a user assigned a specific score. This approach proves highly beneficial in discerning user preferences and gauging the perceived value derived from your product.

3. Connect with Detractors

Leverage NPS data to proactively engage with detractors by providing solutions to their existing challenges. By integrating NPS feedback with insights from other user analytics, you can gain a deeper understanding of their issues, thereby mitigating the risk of churn before it becomes critical.

4. Interact with Passives

Passives present an excellent opportunity to cultivate more promoters. While they generally have a positive customer experience with your product, they require additional attention and personalization. Directly reaching out to passives allows you to explore their experiences and devise solutions that surpass their expectations.

5. Encourage Customer Feedback

Encouraging customers to provide feedback can be challenging. Creating a concise user feedback survey that motivates users to share their opinions is crucial. Keeping the survey brief and focused on a specific topic saves time and ensures clarity in communication about what information you seek.

6. Offer Self-Service Support

Customers can become frustrated when faced with prolonged problem-solving or confusion about using a feature. Implementing self-service support enables customers to independently resolve simpler issues, fostering a sense of accomplishment. Additionally, it allows your support team to concentrate on customers with more complex problems, providing swift solutions.

7. Deliver Outstanding Customer Support

According to HubSpot research, 93% of customers tend to remain loyal to businesses that provide excellent customer service. Exceptional customer support not only enhances NPS but also fuels word-of-mouth marketing. The most effective approach to proactive support and surpassing expectations is establishing an in-app help center.

## Companies That Use Net Promoter Score (NPS)

1. Slack

Within a year, Slack has achieved a remarkable $1 billion valuation, largely due to word-of-mouth advertising tracked through NPS. Bill Macaitis, Slack's CMO, employs NPS to refine every interaction that prospects and customers encounter with Slack. This comprehensive approach to the user experience encompasses not only customer service and sales but also elements such as online advertisements and the legal terms of service.

2. Bonobos

Bonobos aspires to be the most cherished men's clothing brand ever. In early 2014, the company tested an additional step in the shipping process, assessing its impact using NPS software. While they anticipated a few customer inquiries and possible dissatisfaction, the NPS reporting revealed a different narrative: customers strongly disliked the extra step. Armed with this data, Bonobos promptly addressed the issues by reverting the change.

3. Magoosh

Magoosh, an online test preparation company specializing in GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and SAT exams, places significant emphasis on NPS as one of their crucial metrics. They recognize that the success of their service hinges on their customers' achievement of goals beyond just using their product.

Upon observing a decline in NPS for their GMAT product, Magoosh saw it as a warning sign that something was amiss. Investigating further, they discovered that students were dissatisfied because the scores from their Magoosh practice tests did not align with their actual GMAT scores.

In response, Magoosh revamped their NPS collection approach to provide quicker insights while students were still in the study phase. They utilized an NPS tool to pose the NPS question directly within their product. After implementing this change for all GMAT test-takers, their post-exam NPS scores showed a significant improvement.

4. Homebase

John Waldmann, the founder of Homebase, was an early adopter of NPS to monitor customer feedback. He employs NPS in a distinctive manner, using it as a conduit for ongoing, transparent communication between himself and his customers.

Homebase caters to two user segments: business owners and their employees. To ensure satisfaction on both ends, Homebase has seamlessly integrated NPS surveys into their software. Waldmann regularly shares this NPS feedback with his team every week, serving as a proactive measure to identify potential issues and maintain a sharp focus on targeted product development.

5. Airbnb

Airbnb employed NPS data to anticipate forthcoming interactions with the service, including actions like rebooking or recommending to a friend, for a user base exceeding 600,000. The analysis revealed that customers with an NPS score of 10 (promoters) exhibited a 13% higher likelihood of rebooking and a 4% higher likelihood of referring a friend compared to detractors. The findings highlighted NPS as the most significant predictor of future rebooking and referrals.
